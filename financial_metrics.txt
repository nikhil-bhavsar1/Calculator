  TV = FCFn+1 / (WACC - g)
  Where: FCFn+1 = FCFn × (1 + g)

Terminal Value (Exit Multiple - EBITDA)
  TV = Exit Multiple × EBITDAn

Terminal Value (Exit Multiple - EBIT)
  TV = Exit Multiple × EBITn

Terminal Value (Exit Multiple - Sales)
  TV = Exit Multiple × Salesn

Stable Period FCFF
  FCFF (stable) = EBIT(1-T) × (1 - Reinvestment Rate)
  Where: Reinvestment Rate = g / Return on Capital


INTRINSIC VALUATION FORMULAS
-----------------------------

Value of Firm (DCF - FCFF)
  Firm Value = Σ[FCFFt / (1+WACC)^t] + [TVn / (1+WACC)^n]

Value of Equity (DCF - FCFE)
  Equity Value = Σ[FCFEt / (1+Re)^t] + [TVn / (1+Re)^n]

Value of Equity (from Firm Value)
  Equity Value = Firm Value + Cash - Debt - Preferred Stock - Minority Interest

Value Per Share
  Value Per Share = Equity Value / Shares Outstanding


ADJUSTED PRESENT VALUE (APV) FORMULAS
--------------------------------------

Value of Unlevered Firm
  VU = Σ[FCFF / (1+Ru)^t] + TVU
  Where: Ru = Unlevered cost of equity

Unlevered Cost of Equity
  Ru = Rf + βU × ERP

Present Value of Tax Shield (Perpetual Debt)
  PV(Tax Shield) = Tax Rate × Debt

Present Value of Tax Shield (Changing Debt)
  PV(Tax Shield) = Σ[Interest × Tax Rate / (1+Rd)^t]

Total APV
  APV = VU + PV(Tax Shield) - PV(Bankruptcy Costs)


RELATIVE VALUATION FORMULAS
----------------------------

Justified P/E (Stable Growth)
  P/E = Payout Ratio × (1 + g) / (Re - g)
  Alternative: P/E = (1 - Retention Ratio) × (1 + g) / (Re - g)

Justified P/E (High Growth to Stable)
  P/E = [PR × (1+g) × (1 - (1+g)^n/(1+r)^n)] / [(r-g) × (1+r)^n] + [PR × (1+gn) / (r-gn) × (1+r)^n]

Justified P/B Ratio
  P/B = (ROE - g) / (Re - g)

Justified P/S Ratio
  P/S = [Profit Margin × Payout Ratio × (1+g)] / (Re - g)

Justified EV/EBITDA

  d₂ = d₁ - σ√T
  S₀ = Current stock price
  K = Strike price
  r = Risk-free rate
  T = Time to expiration
  σ = Volatility
  N(d) = Cumulative normal distribution

Black-Scholes Put Option Value
  P = Ke^(-rT)N(-d₂) - S₀N(-d₁)


REAL OPTIONS VALUATION
-----------------------

Option to Expand
  Value = PV(Expected Cash Flows) × N(d₁) - Investment Cost × e^(-rT) × N(d₂)

Option to Abandon
  Value = Abandonment Value × e^(-rT) × N(-d₂) - PV(Continuing) × N(-d₁)


PRIVATE COMPANY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS
--------------------------------------

Lack of Marketability Discount
  Discount = 20-35% (typical range)
  Adjusted Value = Base Value × (1 - Discount)

Control Premium
  Premium = 20-40% (typical range)
  Value with Control = Minority Value × (1 + Premium)

Key Person Discount
  Discount varies based on replaceability and importance


========================================================================
15. BENJAMIN GRAHAM FORMULAS
========================================================================

GRAHAM NUMBER (MAXIMUM FAIR VALUE)
-----------------------------------

Graham Number
  Formula: √(22.5 × EPS × BVPS)
  Where: BVPS = Book Value Per Share
  
  Interpretation: Stock is undervalued if trading below Graham Number
  
  Derivation: Based on max P/E of 15 and max P/B of 1.5
  15 × 1.5 = 22.5


INTRINSIC VALUE FORMULAS
-------------------------

Original Graham Formula (1962)
  Intrinsic Value = EPS × (8.5 + 2g)
  
  Where:
  EPS = Trailing 12-month earnings per share
  8.5 = P/E base for no-growth company
  g = Expected annual growth rate (next 7-10 years)

Revised Graham Formula (1974 - with bond yields)
  Intrinsic Value = [EPS × (8.5 + 2g) × 4.4] / Y
  
  Where:
  Y = Current yield on AAA corporate bonds
  4.4 = Average AAA bond yield when formula created
  
  This adjusts for interest rate environment


NET CURRENT ASSET VALUE (NCAV)
-------------------------------

NCAV Per Share
  NCAV = (Current Assets - Total Liabilities) / Shares Outstanding

Graham's NCAV Buy Rule
  Buy when: Stock Price < (2/3 × NCAV)
  
  Conservative variation: Price < 0.5 × NCAV

Net-Net Working Capital
  Net-Net = (Current Assets - Total Liabilities) - (0.5 × Inventory)
  Per Share = Net-Net / Shares Outstanding


DEFENSIVE INVESTOR CRITERIA (GRAHAM'S CHECKLIST)
-------------------------------------------------

1. Company Size
   Annual sales > $100 million (adjust for inflation)
   Today's equivalent: > $500 million

2. Financial Condition
   Current Ratio ≥ 2.0
   Formula: Current Assets / Current Liabilities ≥ 2.0

3. Debt Level

7. P/E Ratio
   Current P/E ≤ 15
   Formula: Stock Price / (3-year average EPS) ≤ 15

8. P/B Ratio
   P/B ≤ 1.5
   Formula: Stock Price / Book Value Per Share ≤ 1.5

9. Combined P/E and P/B
   P/E × P/B ≤ 22.5
   Allows some flexibility: high P/E with low P/B, or vice versa


ENTERPRISING INVESTOR CRITERIA
-------------------------------

1. Financial Condition
   Current Assets ≥ 1.5 × Current Liabilities
   Formula: Current Ratio ≥ 1.5

2. Debt to Working Capital
   Total Debt < 110% of Net Current Assets
   Formula: Total Debt / (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) < 1.1

3. Earnings Stability
   No deficit (loss) in last 5 years
   All 5 years must show positive earnings

4. Dividend Record
   Some current dividend being paid
   (Less stringent than defensive investor)

5. Earnings Growth
   Last year's EPS > EPS from 5 years ago
   Any positive growth acceptable

6. Price Limit
   Price < 120% of Net Tangible Assets
   Formula: Price / (Book Value - Intangibles) < 1.2


MARGIN OF SAFETY FORMULAS
--------------------------

Margin of Safety (Percentage)
  MOS = [(Intrinsic Value - Market Price) / Intrinsic Value] × 100

Graham's Minimum MOS
  Buy only with ≥ 33% margin of safety
  Preferred: ≥ 50% margin of safety
  
  Formula: Market Price ≤ (0.67 × Intrinsic Value)  [33% MOS]
  Formula: Market Price ≤ (0.50 × Intrinsic Value)  [50% MOS]


ASSET-BASED VALUATION METHODS
------------------------------

Liquidation Value Per Share
  Formula: (Current Assets - Total Liabilities - Preferred Stock) / Common Shares
  
  Conservative estimate:
  Liquidation = (0.75 × Receivables) + (0.5 × Inventory) + Cash - Total Liabilities

Book Value Per Share (Tangible)
  Formula: (Total Equity - Intangible Assets - Goodwill) / Shares Outstanding

Reproduction Value
  Estimated cost to reproduce company's assets at current prices
  (Difficult to calculate precisely)


EARNINGS POWER VALUE (EPV)
---------------------------

EPV Formula
  EPV = Adjusted Earnings / Required Rate of Return
  EPV = Adjusted Earnings × (1 / R)

Adjusted Earnings Calculation
  Start with: Reported EBIT
  Adjust for: One-time items, unusual expenses
  Subtract: Maintenance CapEx
  Subtract: Taxes
  = Adjusted Earnings (sustainable earnings)

Full EPV with Growth
  Value = EPV + PV(Growth)
  Where: PV(Growth) = NPV of future investments


WORKING CAPITAL FORMULAS
-------------------------

Net Working Capital
  NWC = Current Assets - Current Liabilities

Working Capital Ratio
  WC Ratio = (Current Assets - Current Liabilities) / Total Assets

Graham's Working Capital Rule
  For industrials: NWC should be ≥ 50% of total debt


GRAHAM'S CENTRAL VALUE CONCEPT
-------------------------------

Central Value (Simplified)
  Value = Assets + (Multiplier × Earning Power)
  
  Where typical multiplier = 10-15 for average company
